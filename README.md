Mexican Tortilla Pricing Analysis
Mexican Tortilla Pricing Analysis
Overview:
This project aims to explore and analyze tortilla pricing trends in Mexico, focusing on the differences in prices among supermarkets, convenience stores, and traditional markets. Using datasets from Kaggle and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, we investigate how tortilla prices have evolved over time and explore potential factors influencing these trends.

Key Features:
Data Exploration: Analyze tortilla price datasets to identify trends and variations across different types of retailers.
Visualizations: Utilize box plots and kernel density estimate plots to visualize price distributions and compare pricing strategies among different retailers.
Trend Analysis: Investigate significant price changes over time, particularly focusing on observed price hikes in mom and pop stores compared to retail stores.
Integration with CPI Data: Contextualize tortilla price trends by correlating with CPI indices, providing insights into inflation rates and cost-of-living changes.
